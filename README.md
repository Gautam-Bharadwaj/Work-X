# PhotonFlow: The One Click Utility Suite

PhotonFlow is a high performance mobile application designed for people who need to manage documents and images without the usual friction. Built with React Native, it focuses on the idea that utility should be instantaneous and private. 

While most tools in this category force you to deal with cluttered ads or cloud uploads, PhotonFlow keeps everything on your device. It is built for speed and designed for users who appreciate a premium, thoughtful interface.

### The Vision

The philosophy behind this project is simple: one tap to action. Whether you are a student or a professional handling dozens of receipts, the app should stay out of your way and just get the job done. Every transition is smooth, and every interaction is designed to feel natural and responsive.

### Core Capabilities

The application handles document scanning through an intelligent interface that detects edges and enhances legibility automatically. For those working with images, the batch conversion tool allows you to switch between JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats in seconds. 

PDF management is handled through a visual workspace where you can merge multiple files or split documents apart using intuitive gestures. Additionally, the built in optimizer helps you reduce file sizes for quick sharing without sacrificing the visual quality of your work.

### Privacy and Performance

Privacy is not a feature here; it is the foundation. Since all processing happens locally on your hardware, your sensitive documents never touch a server. This architectural choice also makes the app incredibly fast, as there is no latency from uploading or downloading files.

### Technical Foundation

The project is built on a modern stack including React Native and NativeWind for styling. State management is handled by Zustand to keep the application light, while the core processing engine utilizes dedicated libraries for high fidelity image and PDF manipulation. For the scanning features, we leverage computer vision to provide real time feedback during capture.

### Getting Started

To set up the project locally, you will need a standard React Native development environment. Start by cloning the repository and installing the necessary dependencies through your terminal. Once the packages are ready, you can launch the application on your preferred emulator or physical device using the standard run commands for Android or iOS.

### Contributing

This project is open for collaboration. If you have ideas for improving the workflow or adding new utilities like optical character recognition or digital signatures, your input is welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit your changes through a pull request.

### About the Developer

PhotonFlow is developed by Kumar Gautam. The goal was to create a tool that combines technical backend scalability with a world class user experience.
